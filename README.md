# Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm

A pure C# library. No external dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing. No binaries. Unit tested.

This code is free to use under the MIT.

## Overview
Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm, also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, is an efficient method to detect cycles in sequences generated by a function. It is widely used in graph theory, linked lists, and function iteration problems. The algorithm operates in O(n) time complexity with O(1) space complexity, making it a highly efficient cycle detection method.

## How It Works
1. The algorithm uses two pointers, a `tortoise` (slow pointer) and a `hare` (fast pointer).
2. The `tortoise` moves one step at a time, while the `hare` moves two steps.
3. If there is a cycle in the sequence, the two pointers will eventually meet.
4. Once a cycle is detected, another phase determines the starting point of the cycle and its length.

## Usage in This Library
The implementation in this library provides a static method `FindCycle<T>` within the `FloydCycleDetector` class.

### Method Signature
```csharp
public static CycleDetectionResult<T> FindCycle<T>(T start, Func<T, T> f)
```

### Parameters
- `start`: The initial value to begin the sequence.
- `f`: A function that generates the next element in the sequence.

### Returns
- A `CycleDetectionResult<T>` object containing:
  - `CycleStart`: The first element of the detected cycle.
  - `CycleLength`: The length of the cycle.
  - `NonCycleLength`: The length of the sequence before the cycle begins.

## Example Usage
### Detecting a Simple Cycle
```csharp
int start = 0;
Func<int, int> f = x => (x + 1) % 10; // A mod-10 cycle
CycleDetectionResult<int> result = FloydCycleDetector.FindCycle(start, f);
Console.WriteLine($"Cycle starts at: {result.CycleStart}");
Console.WriteLine($"Cycle length: {result.CycleLength}");
Console.WriteLine($"Non-cycle length: {result.NonCycleLength}");
```

### Detecting a Cycle in a Custom Mapping
```csharp
var mapping = new Dictionary<int, int> { {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 3} };
Func<int, int> f = x => mapping[x];
CycleDetectionResult<int> result = FloydCycleDetector.FindCycle(1, f);
Console.WriteLine($"Cycle starts at: {result.CycleStart}");
Console.WriteLine($"Cycle length: {result.CycleLength}");
Console.WriteLine($"Non-cycle length: {result.NonCycleLength}");
```

## Unit Tests
This library includes unit tests using MSTest to validate the implementation. The test cases cover:
- Immediate cycles
- Modular cycles
- Custom function-based cycles
- String-based cycles
